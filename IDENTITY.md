# IDENTITY

## What this is
A Flux-aligned **AI literacy framework delivered as a tool pack**: row packs + scenarios + single-column rubrics that help learners steward shared context with AI without outsourcing responsibility.

## What this is not
- Not a curriculum.
- Not a prompt library.
- Not a leveled proficiency system.
- Not a policy stack (alignment is supported; policy is context-specific).

## Who it’s for
Teachers, coaches, and teacher educators who want a portable way to assess and teach ownership, verification, context building, UNKNWN handling, and integrity/boundaries across domains.

## What stays stable
The five stable dimensions and their meaning (Ownership, Verification, Context building, UNKNWN handling, Integrity & boundaries) plus the single-column rubric structure.

## What is remixable
Scenarios, row packs, row sets, and domain-specific evidence examples. Alignment tags can be adapted to local frameworks.

## How it connects
Flux protocol provides the interaction invariants (POKE/UNKNWN/NOGUARD). External frameworks provide shared vocabulary. This repo provides classroom-ready artifacts that make those commitments observable.
