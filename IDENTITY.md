## Problem statement (interaction frame):
Models infer an interaction frame (what we’re doing together). Without an explicit stance, that frame often collapses toward speed, compliance, and unearned certainty. In other words, models quickly “guess” whether this is help-me-fast or help-me-learn.

## Flux stance (engine):
Flux represents a field-shaped interaction stance—a way of holding a shared context loop (a relational field) so it doesn’t collapse into speed, certainty, or outsourced authority. The protocol supplies invariants (POKE / UNKNWN / NOGUARD) that stabilize a relational modality—they act like constraints that free bandwidth (by preventing collapse into speed/compliance/certainty), so ownership, verification, and productive uncertainty can emerge.

By “relational field,” we mean the shared interaction context that shapes what the model infers we’re doing, what we infer the model is doing, and how we act responsibly within that shared context.

## Operationalization:
This repo operationalizes those invariants as core practices that are auditable in learner artifacts (rubrics, checks, and revision traces).

## What this is
A Flux-aligned **AI literacy framework and tool pack**: row packs + scenarios + single-column rubrics that help learners steward shared context with AI without outsourcing responsibility.

## What this is not
- Not a curriculum.
- Not a prompt library.
- Not a leveled proficiency system.
- Not a policy stack (alignment is supported; policy is context-specific).

## Who it’s for
Teachers, coaches, and teacher educators who want a portable way to assess and teach ownership, verification, context building, staying with the unknown, and integrity/boundaries across domains.

## What stays stable
The five core practices and their meaning (Ownership, Verification, Context building, Staying with the unknown, Integrity & boundaries) plus the reliance on meta-cognition assessing (i.e. single-column rubric structure.)

## What is remixable
Scenarios, row packs, row sets, and domain-specific evidence examples. Alignment tags can be adapted to local frameworks.

## How it connects
Flux protocol provides the interaction invariants (POKE/UNKNWN/NOGUARD). External frameworks provide shared vocabulary. This repo provides classroom-ready artifacts that make those commitments observable.
