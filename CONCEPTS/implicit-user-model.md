# Implicit user model (ToM analogy)

As stated in Working Axiom 2, we assume that models infer a working model of the user and task to decide how to respond. It is useful to consider this a Theory of Mind analogy, because it helps explain *why* interaction frames drift: the model is always making an as-if guess about intent, constraints, and desired mode (help-me-fast vs help-me-learn). This is not a research claim the framework depends on proving; it’s a way to operationalize Working Axiom 2 so people can notice and steer the interaction frame.

In this framework, the point is operational: if the model’s inferred stance collapses toward speed or compliance, the shared interaction frame shifts and responsibility blurs. Core practices are the observable counterweight.
