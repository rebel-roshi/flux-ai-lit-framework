# Interaction frame (concept)

An interaction frame is what the model infers we’re doing together, what we infer the model is doing, and how we act responsibly within that shared context.

When the frame is not explicit, it tends to drift toward speed, compliance, or unearned certainty. This framework treats that drift as a design problem and answers it with stance, core practices, and auditable artifacts.
