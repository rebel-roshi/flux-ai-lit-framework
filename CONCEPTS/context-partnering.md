# Context Partnering
Flux/Context Partnering is an AI literacy framework that also strengthens metacognition—because AI forces the question: who owns meaning, how do we verify, and how do we stay honest in uncertainty?

## Claim
Any conversation continues because **humans invest attention to keep it going**.
AI can participate by enriching the context, but it does not “want” the conversation to continue.

## Why it matters
If we treat AI as an answer machine, we train:
- outsourcing thinking
- impatience with uncertainty
- confidence without verification
- hidden dependence

If we treat AI as a context partner, we practice:
- agency (“I remain responsible for meaning”)
- epistemic humility (“what do we know / not know?”)
- verification and evidence
- relational integrity (non-coercive co-creation)

## Flux braid (portable, non-esoteric)
- POKE: name assumptions and frame pressure
- UNKNWN: keep uncertainty alive long enough to learn
- NOGUARD: honest disclosure of intent, limits, and responsibility
