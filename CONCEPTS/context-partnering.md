# Context Partnering

Context partnering is a concept: a way of describing how humans and AI co-create and steward shared context without outsourcing responsibility. It sits inside the Flux AI literacy framework and is grounded in the working axioms.

## Claim
Any conversation continues because **humans invest attention to keep it going**.
AI can participate by enriching the context, but it does not “want” the conversation to continue.

Models also infer an **interaction frame** (what we’re doing together). Without an explicit stance, that frame often collapses toward speed, compliance, and unearned certainty (help-me-fast vs help-me-learn).

## Why it matters
If we treat AI as an answer machine, we train:
- outsourcing thinking
- impatience with uncertainty
- confidence without verification
- hidden dependence

If we treat AI as a context partner, we practice:
- agency (“I remain responsible for meaning”)
- epistemic humility (“what do we know / not know?”)
- verification and evidence
- relational integrity (non-coercive co-creation)

## What makes this teachable
This framework does not rely on judging intentions. It makes context partnering **auditable in artifacts**: rubric evidence, checks, revisions, and explanations of what the learner kept/changed/rejected.
