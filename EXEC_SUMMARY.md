# Executive Summary — Flux AI Literacy Framework

This repository is a **framework + tool pack** for practicing **context partnering** with AI: co‑creating and stewarding shared context with an AI system **without outsourcing responsibility**.

It is designed to travel: someone who wasn’t “in the room” can pick it up, run a scenario, and produce **auditable artifacts** (rubric evidence, checks, and revision traces). It is also designed to preserve depth: the goal is not faster answers, but better responsibility, verification, and learning under uncertainty.

## What problem this addresses
AI systems respond within an inferred **interaction frame** (what we’re doing together). Without an explicit stance, that frame often collapses toward **speed, compliance, and unearned certainty** (help‑me‑fast vs help‑me‑learn).

Flux AI literacy treats that drift as a design problem: the work is to make the frame **visible**, keep responsibility with the learner, and re‑enter the work when it collapses.

## Framework spine (how this is organized)
**Working axioms → Concepts → Core practices → Cards → Artifacts**

- **Working axioms**: foundational assumptions for the framework.
- **Concepts**: vocabulary for what is happening in the interaction (e.g., context partnering, interaction frame).
- **Core practices**: the stable, cross‑domain practices the framework trains and assesses.
- **Cards**: facilitator‑facing prompts (common drifts → re‑entry questions).
- **Artifacts**: row packs, scenarios, and single‑column rubrics that make practice auditable.

---

## What stays minimal (and what makes it “full‑fledged”)
**Minimal** here means:
- a minimal set of **working axioms**,
- a minimal set of **core practices** that remain stable across domains,
- and a minimal set of **artifacts** needed to practice and audit the work.

“Full‑fledged” does **not** mean more bureaucracy. It means the spine is explicit and auditable:
- foundations and concepts are named,
- practices are defined,
- facilitator moves are supported,
- and evidence shows up in learner artifacts.

## The five core practices (what becomes observable)
The framework trains and assesses five stable practices across domains:
1) **Ownership (agency / authorship)**
2) **Verification (validate with evidence)**
3) **Context building (make the frame workable)**
4) **Staying with the unknown**
5) **Integrity & boundaries (safe / honest / appropriate)**

These are defined canonically in `FOUNDATIONS/core-practices.md` and made teachable through facilitator cards and rubrics.

---

## Portable structure vs cultivated judgment (a practical distinction)
- **Portable structure** is what travels easily: the rubrics, scenarios, row packs, and routing that let people practice without the author present.
- **Cultivated judgment** is what develops through experience: noticing drift, naming what’s missing, and choosing a re-entry question without flattening the practice into a checklist.

This repo aims to support cultivated judgment by:
- encoding common drifts and re-entry questions,
- grounding evaluation in observable evidence,
- and keeping the protocol connection present without requiring philosophical mastery.

---

## How to use this (one common loop)
1) Pick a scenario.
2) Use the **student rubric** (and optionally the teacher rubric).
3) Do a first pass.
4) Identify **one strong move** and **one missing move**.
5) Re‑enter with a **re‑entry question**, then revise once.
6) Keep the evidence in artifacts: checks, notes, revision traces.
