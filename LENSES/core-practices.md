# Core practices (cross-domain)

These practice cards help teacher educators notice evidence and choose next moves without turning the framework into a checklist. Each practice is defined primarily by reference to existing rows, rubrics, and examples.

---

## Ownership (agency / authorship)
**What this practice notices:** Who is responsible for meaning in the work, and how that responsibility shows up in choices and explanations.

**Evidence cues (look fors):**
- Student names the goal in their own words.
- Student makes and justifies a choice (method/tool/representation).
- Student distinguishes their thinking from tool output.

**Common drift:**
- “Because AI said so” or “because the teacher said so,” without ownership of reasoning.

**Re-entry question:**
- Where is authorship visible, and where is it deferred?

**Defined-by-reference:**
- [Teacher rubric](../RUBRIC/teacher-single-column-rubric.md#1-ownership-agency--authorship)
- [AI literacy core row pack](../ROW_PACKS/ai-literacy-core.md#ownership-agency--authorship)
- [Teacher rubric example](../RUBRIC/EXAMPLES/teacher-rubric-example-define-a-line-elementary.md#row-1-ownership-agency--authorship)

**Protocol note:** NOGUARD — ownership without outsourcing authority.

## Verification (validate with evidence)
**What this practice notices:** Whether claims are treated as candidates and checked with domain evidence.

**Evidence cues (look fors):**
- A concrete check is shown (test, example, source, second method).
- A correction is made after checking.
- A failure mode is named and tested.

**Common drift:**
- Accepting plausible output without a check.

**Re-entry question:**
- What check would make this claim trustworthy here?

**Defined-by-reference:**
- [Teacher rubric](../RUBRIC/teacher-single-column-rubric.md#2-verification-validate-with-evidence)
- [AI literacy core row pack](../ROW_PACKS/ai-literacy-core.md#verification-validate-with-evidence)
- [Teacher rubric example](../RUBRIC/EXAMPLES/teacher-rubric-example-define-a-line-elementary.md#row-2-verification-validate-with-evidence)

**Protocol note:** POKE — challenge the first answer with evidence.

## Context building (make the frame workable)
**What this practice notices:** Whether the frame is made workable (terms, assumptions, constraints) before trust or use.

**Evidence cues (look fors):**
- Key terms or assumptions are clarified.
- Close concepts are distinguished (example vs non-example).
- The question or prompt is improved for clarity or testability.

**Common drift:**
- Working inside a vague or shifting frame without naming it.

**Re-entry question:**
- What definition or constraint would make the frame workable right now?

**Defined-by-reference:**
- [Teacher rubric](../RUBRIC/teacher-single-column-rubric.md#3-context-building-make-the-frame-workable)
- [AI literacy core row pack](../ROW_PACKS/ai-literacy-core.md#context-building-make-the-frame-workable)
- [Teacher rubric example](../RUBRIC/EXAMPLES/teacher-rubric-example-define-a-line-elementary.md#row-3-context-building-make-the-frame-workable)

**Protocol note:** POKE — surface assumptions to sharpen the frame.

## Staying with the unknown
**What this practice notices:** Whether uncertainty is named without premature closure, and movement is made toward a next step.

**Evidence cues (look fors):**
- A specific unknown is named (not just “I’m stuck”).
- A bounded next step is chosen.
- Two possibilities are held with a test to decide.

**Common drift:**
- Collapsing uncertainty into avoidance or a guess.

**Re-entry question:**
- What is still unclear, and what is the smallest next step that stays with it?

**Defined-by-reference:**
- [Teacher rubric](../RUBRIC/teacher-single-column-rubric.md#4-staying-with-the-unknown)
- [AI literacy core row pack](../ROW_PACKS/ai-literacy-core.md#staying-with-the-unknown)
- [Teacher rubric example](../RUBRIC/EXAMPLES/teacher-rubric-example-define-a-line-elementary.md#row-4-staying-with-the-unknown)

**Protocol note:** UNKNWN — remain unfixed long enough to learn.

---

## Integrity & boundaries (safe / honest / appropriate)
**What this practice notices:** Whether the work stays honest, safe, and appropriate to policy and purpose.

**Evidence cues (look fors):**
- Tool use is disclosed and consistent with norms.
- Private or inappropriate data is not shared.
- The student chooses a non-AI path when appropriate.

**Common drift:**
- Hidden outsourcing or unclear tool use.

**Re-entry question:**
- What needs to be disclosed or bounded for this to stay safe and honest?

**Defined-by-reference:**
- [Teacher rubric](../RUBRIC/teacher-single-column-rubric.md#5-integrity--boundaries-safe--honest--appropriate)
- [AI literacy core row pack](../ROW_PACKS/ai-literacy-core.md#integrity--boundaries-safe--honest--appropriate)
- [Teacher rubric example](../RUBRIC/EXAMPLES/teacher-rubric-example-define-a-line-elementary.md#row-5-integrity--boundaries-safe--honest--appropriate)

**Protocol note:** NOGUARD — integrity and boundaries without coercion.
