# Row Pack: AI Literacy Core (Flux-aligned)

## What this is
A small, stable set of rows you can mix into **any** assignment (math, writing, science, history, etc.)
to practice AI literacy as **context partnering**: ownership, verification, context building, staying with the unknown,
and integrity/boundaries.

## How to use
- Pick **2–4 rows** from this pack for a given assignment (avoid overload).
- Put them into the student rubric (if AI is explicitly in the task) and/or keep them teacher-only as an overlay.
- Teacher scaffolds the **Understanding** column (“Meets looks like…”) for each chosen row.

## Tagging
- Use 1–2 primary tags per row (see `ALIGNMENT.md`).
- Tags are descriptive, not evaluative.

---

## Ownership (agency / authorship)

### Row: `I can state my goal and make choices about how to use tools (including AI) to reach it.`
- Tags: `DP:UNDERSTAND`, `AILIT:ENGAGE`
- Teacher “Understanding” scaffold (Meets looks like):
  - Student states the task goal in their own words.
  - Student names at least one choice they made (method/tool/representation) and why.
- Evidence ideas: “My plan…”, “I chose to… because…”, quick strategy note.

### Row: `I can explain what parts are mine vs tool-suggested—and why I kept, changed, or rejected them.`
- Tags: `DP:EVALUATE`, `AILIT:MANAGE`
- Teacher “Understanding” scaffold:
  - Student distinguishes tool output from their own thinking.
  - Student records at least one keep/change/reject decision with a reason.
- Evidence ideas: “AI suggested __; I changed __ because __.”

---

## Verification (validate with evidence)

### Row: `I can verify a tool/AI claim using domain evidence (test, example, source, or second method).`
- Tags: `DP:EVALUATE`, `AILIT:MANAGE`
- Teacher “Understanding” scaffold:
  - Student performs at least one domain-appropriate check.
  - Student records what the check showed and any correction.
- Evidence ideas: test case, counterexample, citation, second solution path, point-check, unit check.

### Row: `I can stress-test an answer by asking: “What would make this fail?” and trying at least one check.`
- Tags: `DP:EVALUATE`, `AILIT:ENGAGE`
- Teacher “Understanding” scaffold:
  - Student identifies a plausible failure mode (edge case, exception, tricky example).
  - Student runs one check aimed at that failure mode.
- Evidence ideas: “Tricky case: __. It fails/holds because __.”

### Row: `I can cross-check with a second source or method when accuracy matters.`
- Tags: `DP:EVALUATE`, `AILIT:MANAGE`
- Teacher “Understanding” scaffold:
  - Student consults a second source/method (notes/textbook/peer/alternate strategy).
  - Student resolves or records differences.
- Evidence ideas: “Source A says __; Source B says __; I conclude __ because __.”

---

## Context building (make the frame workable)

### Row: `I can clarify key terms/assumptions/constraints before I trust an answer.`
- Tags: `DP:UNDERSTAND`, `AILIT:ENGAGE`
- Teacher “Understanding” scaffold:
  - Student names at least one key term or assumption.
  - Student uses it to guide or revise their work.
- Evidence ideas: “By ‘line’ we mean…”, “Assuming __, then…”

### Row: `I can ask a better question to improve the context (more specific, more checkable, or more constrained).`
- Tags: `DP:UNDERSTAND`, `AILIT:CREATE`
- Teacher “Understanding” scaffold:
  - Student revises a question/prompt to reduce ambiguity or increase testability.
  - Student explains what changed and why.
- Evidence ideas: original question → revised question; “I added __ so I could check __.”

---

## Staying with the unknown

### Row: `I can name what I don’t know yet and take one bounded next step.`
- Tags: `DP:EVALUATE`, `AILIT:ENGAGE`
- Teacher “Understanding” scaffold:
  - Student identifies a specific unknown (not “I don’t get it”).
  - Student chooses a next step (try a smaller case, ask a targeted question, run a check).
- Evidence ideas: “I’m unsure about __. Next I will __.”

### Row: `I can keep two possibilities open and say what evidence would decide between them.`
- Tags: `DP:EVALUATE`, `AILIT:MANAGE`
- Teacher “Understanding” scaffold:
  - Student states two plausible interpretations/answers.
  - Student names the evidence/test that would decide.
- Evidence ideas: “Either __ or __. I can test by __.”

---

## Integrity & boundaries (safe / honest / appropriate)

### Row: `I can follow our class norms for tool/AI use (privacy, attribution, appropriate use).`
- Tags: `DP:UNDERSTAND`, `AILIT:MANAGE`
- Teacher “Understanding” scaffold:
  - Student follows the stated policy (no sensitive data; attribution if required).
  - Student’s work shows academic integrity (no hidden outsourcing).
- Evidence ideas: attribution note, tool-use statement, “What I used / didn’t use.”

### Row: `I can decide when NOT to use AI (or when to stop using it) and choose a better approach.`
- Tags: `DP:USE`, `AILIT:DESIGN`
- Teacher “Understanding” scaffold:
  - Student names a reason not to use AI (policy, risk, mismatch, integrity).
  - Student chooses an alternate method (notes, peer, teacher, own attempt).
- Evidence ideas: “I didn’t use AI because __; instead I __.”

### Row: `If I use AI, I can document what I asked and what I did with it—without sharing private info.`
- Tags: `DP:USE`, `AILIT:MANAGE`
- Teacher “Understanding” scaffold:
  - Student records a prompt/question (or accurate summary).
  - Student records how they used it (kept/changed/rejected) and what they verified.
- Evidence ideas: prompt snippet, output summary, verification note, revision note.
