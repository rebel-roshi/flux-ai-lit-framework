# Row Pack: Math Content (Elementary) — “Define a line”

## What this is
A content row pack for an elementary “define a line” lesson. Mix with `ROW_PACKS/ai-literacy-core.md`
when AI/context partnering is part of the assignment.

## Suggested content rows (teacher-chosen)
- `I can draw a line and show it goes on forever in both directions.`
- `I can explain the difference between a line, a line segment, and a ray using pictures and words.`
- `I can give an example and a non-example of a line and explain why.`
- (Optional extension) `I can explain why arrows mean “continues forever.”`

## Evidence ideas (domain)
- drawing with arrows on both ends
- labeled line vs segment vs ray
- example + non-example + “rule it breaks”
- one sentence explanation in own words
