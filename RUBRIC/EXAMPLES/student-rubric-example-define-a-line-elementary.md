# Example Student Single Column Rubric (Elementary) — “Define a line”

> This file is an **example** of how a teacher might scaffold the “Understanding” column and choose learning-target rows.
> Students would still select **one column per row** and write their own evidence.

---

## How it works (reminder)
- Each row is a learning target.
- The teacher provides the **Understanding** column (what “meets” looks like).
- For each row, the student chooses **one column** that best matches their current state and writes brief evidence there.

## Row set (teacher-chosen)

### Learning Target 1: I can draw a line and show it goes on forever in both directions.

| Not curious | Struggling | Understanding | Excelling |
|---|---|---|---|
|   |   | ☐ **If this is me right now, my evidence:**<br><br>**Meets looks like (teacher definition):**<br>- I can draw a straight line (using a ruler or careful drawing).<br>- It makes sense to me that arrows on both ends show the line keeps going forever.<br>- I can show “forever” by drawing arrows on both ends of the line.<br><br>**My evidence (pick 1–3):**<br>- <br><br>**Question / next step (optional, 1 line):**<br>-  |  |

### Learning Target 2: I can explain the difference between a line, a line segment, and a ray using pictures and words.

| Not curious | Struggling | Understanding | Excelling |
|---|---|---|---|
|   |   | ☐ **If this is me right now, my evidence:**<br><br>**Meets looks like (teacher definition):**<br>- I can explain (with pictures and words) that a **line** is straight and keeps going forever in both directions (arrows on both ends).<br>- I can explain that a **line segment** is straight but stops at two endpoints.<br>- I can explain that a **ray** is straight, starts at one endpoint, and keeps going forever in one direction (one arrow).<br><br>**My evidence (pick 1–3):**<br>- <br><br>**Question / next step (optional, 1 line):**<br>-  |  |

---

### Learning Target 3: I can give an example and a non-example of a line and explain why.

| Not curious | Struggling | Understanding | Excelling |
|---|---|---|---|
|   |   | ☐ **If this is me right now, my evidence:**<br><br>**Meets looks like (teacher definition):**<br>- I can give a correct example of a line (straight + arrows on both ends).<br>- I can give a correct non-example (like a curve, a segment, or a ray).<br>- I can explain why the non-example is not a line (what rule it breaks).<br><br>**My evidence (pick 1–3):**<br>- <br><br>**Question / next step (optional, 1 line):**<br>-  |  |

## Optional AI row (Pattern A)
Use this only if the assignment explicitly involves AI.

### Learning Target 4 (optional): I used AI as a context partner responsibly.

| Not curious | Struggling | Understanding | Excelling |
|---|---|---|---|
|  |  | ☐ **If this is me right now, my evidence:**<br><br>**Meets looks like (teacher definition):**<br>- I can show what I asked the AI (my prompt or question).<br>- I can use my own drawings/examples to check the AI’s answer.<br>- I can explain what I changed after checking (or why I didn’t need to change anything).<br><br>**My evidence:**<br>-  |  |
