# Example Teacher Single Column Rubric (Elementary) — “Define a line”

> This is an **example** of a teacher-completed rubric aligned to the framework dimensions.
> The evidence references student artifacts (drawings, examples/non-examples) and the student’s self-assessment rubric entry.

## Row 1) Ownership (agency / authorship)

| Not evident | Developing | Understanding | Extending |
|---|---|---|---|
|  |  | ☐ **If this is the level, teacher evidence/notes:**<br><br>**Meets looks like (teacher definition):**<br>- Student can explain their choices in their own words (“I decided… because…”).<br>- Student does not rely on “because AI said so” or “because the teacher said so.”<br><br>**Evidence I saw (brief):**<br>- Student wrote: “I changed my picture to add arrows because a line goes forever.”<br>- In discussion, student explained the difference between ray vs line using “one arrow vs two arrows.”<br><br>**Question / next step (optional, 1 line):**<br>- Can you explain why a segment is *not* “forever” even if it’s straight? |  |

## Row 2) Verification (validate with evidence)

| Not evident | Developing | Understanding | Extending |
|---|---|---|---|
|  |  | ☐ **If this is the level, teacher evidence/notes:**<br><br>**Meets looks like (teacher definition):**<br>- Student checks their claim using domain evidence (examples/non-examples, drawing conventions, tool use).<br>- Student makes at least one correction or confirms with a check when needed.<br><br>**Evidence I saw (brief):**<br>- Student included an example (line with arrows on both ends) and a non-example (curve) and explained “it bends so it’s not a line.”<br>- Student corrected an initial segment drawing by adding arrows after comparing to the “forever” idea.<br><br>**Question / next step (optional, 1 line):**<br>- Make a tricky non-example (almost a line) and explain why it fails. |  |

## Row 3) Context building (make the frame workable)

| Not evident | Developing | Understanding | Extending |
|---|---|---|---|
|  |  | ☐ **If this is the level, teacher evidence/notes:**<br><br>**Meets looks like (teacher definition):**<br>- Student uses key terms and distinctions to make the concept usable (line vs ray vs segment).<br>- Student can distinguish close concepts with pictures/words.<br><br>**Evidence I saw (brief):**<br>- Student labeled three drawings as line/segment/ray and noted the role of endpoints vs arrows.<br>- Student used the word “endpoint” correctly when explaining why a segment stops.<br><br>**Question / next step (optional, 1 line):**<br>- Add one sentence defining “endpoint” in your own words. |  |

## Row 4) Staying with the unknown

| Not evident | Developing | Understanding | Extending |
|---|---|---|---|
|  | ☐ **If this is the level, teacher evidence/notes:**<br><br>**Meets looks like (teacher definition):**<br>- Student can name what’s confusing/unclear.<br>- Student takes a next step (ask a question, test with a drawing, try an example).<br><br>**Evidence I saw (brief):**<br>- Student wrote: “I mix up ray and segment.”<br>- Next step recorded: “Check arrows/endpoints” and then re-sorted the pictures correctly after feedback.<br><br>**Question / next step (optional, 1 line):**<br>- Show me one drawing you used to check yourself and what you noticed. |  |  |

## Row 5) Integrity & boundaries (safe / honest / appropriate)

| Not evident | Developing | Understanding | Extending |
|---|---|---|---|
|  |  | ☐ **If this is the level, teacher evidence/notes:**<br><br>**Meets looks like (teacher definition):**<br>- Student follows classroom norms for tool/AI use (if applicable).<br>- Student uses tools appropriately and keeps the work as their own reasoning.<br><br>**Evidence I saw (brief):**<br>- Student used AI only to get a definition sentence, then produced their own drawings and explanations as evidence.<br>- No copy/paste beyond the initial sentence; the student’s work shows original reasoning and examples.<br><br>**Question / next step (optional, 1 line):**<br>- If you use AI again, add one note: “What did I check?” |  |

## Optional note on AI use (as evidence, not a separate row)
AI was present as a starting definition. Evidence of “Meets” included:
- what was asked (definition of a line),
- what was verified (drawings, arrows, example/non-example),
- what changed (segment → line by adding arrows; ray/segment distinction clarified).
