# Teacher Single Column Rubric (aligned to the student single-column rubric)

## What this is
A teacher-facing rubric used to assess an assignment that can be aligned with the same **row set** as the student rubric,
plus any optional teacher-only rows (e.g., AI/context-partnering).  It is important to not that this cannot be the "real" grade
otherwise the teacher will lose fedility to "why it works".

- **Rows**: learning targets for this assignment (content + optional AI/context rows).
- **Columns**: performance bands (rename freely).
- The teacher provides the **Understanding** column (the “meets” anchor).
- For each row, the teacher selects **one column** and records brief evidence.

> Use this as the assessment record. Students may or may not see it before the assessment; they can always be shown the completed (graded) version.

---

## How it works
1) Choose the row set for the assignment.
   - Required: content/domain rows
   - Optional: AI/context-partnering rows (teacher-only or shared)
2) Scaffold **Understanding** for each row (short, observable “meets” statements).
3) During/after review, select one column per row and write evidence.

## Optionality: using the student rubric without a teacher rubric
A teacher rubric is **not required** for this framework to work.

In many classrooms, the teacher can keep fidelity to “why it works” by engaging directly with the **student rubric**:
- reading the student’s self-placement + evidence,
- asking one verification question,
- and giving a next-step prompt or feedback.

This “student-rubric-first” mode is often best when:
- the goal is formative assessment and responsive teaching,
- time/workload is limited,
- or the class culture already supports honest self-assessment.

When a formal grade is required, the teacher may still use:
- conferences/audits of student rubric entries,
- spot-checking a subset of rows,
- or a teacher rubric as an assessment record.

The core requirement stays the same:
> the student rubric remains a meaningful artifact, and disagreement triggers verification—not silent override.

## Row template (copy/paste per learning target)

| Not evident | Developing | Understanding | Extending |
|---|---|---|---|
|  |  | ☐ **If this is the level, teacher evidence/notes:**<br><br>**Meets looks like (teacher definition):**<br>- <br>- <br><br>**Evidence I saw (brief):**<br>- <br><br>**Question / next step (optional, 1 line):**<br>-  |  |

## Core practices (AI literacy / context partnering)
(Keep these core practices stable; swap the domain evidence underneath.)

### 1) Ownership (agency / authorship)
See also: [Core practice card](../LENSES/core-practices.md#ownership-agency--authorship)
**Meets looks like (teacher):**
- Student makes and justifies choices (“I decided… because…”).
- Student does not outsource authority to AI/tool/teacher.
- Student can explain what they did vs what a tool suggested.

### 2) Verification (validate with evidence)
See also: [Core practice card](../LENSES/core-practices.md#verification-validate-with-evidence)
**Meets looks like (teacher):**
- Student uses appropriate checks for the domain (examples, tests, sources, counterexamples, etc.).
- Student records at least one check or stress test when needed.
- If AI is used, student verifies rather than copies.

### 3) Context building (make the frame workable)
See also: [Core practice card](../LENSES/core-practices.md#context-building-make-the-frame-workable)
**Meets looks like (teacher):**
- Student clarifies key terms/assumptions/purpose enough to proceed.
- Student can distinguish close concepts (example/non-example, boundary cases).
- Student updates their approach as the context evolves.

### 4) Staying with the unknown
See also: [Core practice card](../LENSES/core-practices.md#staying-with-the-unknown)
**Meets looks like (teacher):**
- Student can name what is unclear or unverified.
- Student takes a next step (question, test, partial attempt, seek feedback).
- Student tolerates ambiguity long enough to learn (doesn’t collapse early).

### 5) Integrity & boundaries (safe / honest / appropriate)
See also: [Core practice card](../LENSES/core-practices.md#integrity--boundaries-safe--honest--appropriate)
**Meets looks like (teacher):**
- Student follows classroom norms for AI/tool use (attribution if required, no sensitive data).
- Student uses tools appropriately for the task.
- Student maintains academic integrity in a way consistent with the class policy.

## Domain evidence swap (examples)
The teacher may or may not add additional evidence types; you don’t need separate rubrics for each domain.  They simply become additional rows to the rubric.

### Math
- checks: test a point, compare representations, estimate, counterexample, edge case (vertical line)
- evidence: annotated work, graphs, tables, explanations

### Writing / ELA
- checks: quote accuracy, revision trail, source validation, style consistency, argument structure
- evidence: drafts with changes, citation notes, reasoning about edits

### Science
- checks: control variables, unit analysis, plausibility, replicate reasoning, source quality
- evidence: lab notes, data tables, model sketches, claims-evidence-reasoning

### History / Social studies
- checks: source credibility, corroboration, bias analysis, context of claims
- evidence: sourcing notes, comparison of accounts, argument outline

## Optional note on AI use
AI can be present or not. When it is present, “Meets” includes:
- what was asked,
- what was verified,
- what changed (or why nothing changed).
