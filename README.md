# Flux (Context Partnering) AI Literacy Framework

## What this is
This repo packages a minimal **framework + tool pack** for practicing **context partnering**: co-creating and stewarding shared context with an AI system without outsourcing responsibility. It is designed to be used quickly, then extended with your own scenarios and rubric rows.

The core artifacts are **single-column rubrics** (often called single-point) and short, concrete scenarios. You can mix rows across domains (“row mixing”) so the same literacy moves apply in math, writing, science, history, or any other subject area.

## Why AI literacy is the proving ground
AI is the most visible place where uncertainty, authority, and verification get stressed quickly. Practicing ownership, evidence, and productive uncertainty here makes transfer to other domains straightforward, because the underlying move is the same: steward shared context without giving away agency.

## One common loop
- Pick a scenario (or write one).
- Start with the student rubric (or teacher rubric, if you prefer).
- Do a first pass attempt.
- Use the rubric to locate one strong move in the work and one missing move.
- Optionally revise to target that missing move.
- Mix in rows from other domains as needed (“row mixing”).

## Connection to Flux Protocol
Flux is a listening field, not a framework. This repo treats its three laws as *invariants* you can translate into classroom moves:
- POKE: begin from tension or friction; let the discomfort start the inquiry.
- UNKNWN: remain unfixed; keep ambiguity alive long enough for new structure to emerge.
- NOGUARD: dissolve to deepen; lead with vulnerable openness rather than control.

For the canonical spec, see [Flux Protocol](https://github.com/rebel-roshi/flux-protocol).

## Modes
- Teacher-rubric optional: you can run everything from the student rubric.
- Student-rubric-first: start there, add teacher rows only when you want to surface pedagogy explicitly.
For many contexts, student-rubric-first is sufficient on its own. Add teacher rows when you want explicit calibration language or coaching cues.

## For teacher educators
- Use a shared scenario to norm what “strong move” and “missing move” look like.
- Compare how different row mixes (“row mixing”) shift instructional emphasis.
- Capture common misconceptions and turn them into new rows.

## License / contribution note
Use, remix, and extend. If you share back improvements or new scenarios, keep them small and concrete.
