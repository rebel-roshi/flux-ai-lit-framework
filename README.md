# Context Partnering AI Literacy (Flux-aligned)

## North star
AI literacy is the ability to **co-create and steward shared context** with a powerful context-enriching system,
without losing human **wanting**, responsibility, or contact.

AI can enrich a context. **It does not want.**
Humans want—understanding, belonging, truth, beauty, power, safety, play.
Education is where those wants become visible and can be shaped with care.

## What this is
A Flux-aligned, educator-friendly lens for AI literacy:
- **Context partnering** over transactional usage
- Evidence, reflection, and repair over “prompt tricks”
- A **single-point (one-column) rubric** as a mirror, not a grading ladder

## What this isn’t
- A tool tutorial
- A compliance program
- A leveling system to game

### Why this is framed as AI literacy (but extends beyond AI)
We treat **context partnering** as the core skill and **AI literacy** as the most visible proving ground.

AI systems are powerful context-enrichers that can create the illusion of understanding and certainty.
That pressure exposes the exact capacities we want students to develop:
ownership, verification, productive uncertainty, and integrity.

Once those capacities are practiced under AI pressure, they transfer naturally to other domains
(math, writing, science, history), because the underlying skill is the same:
co-creating and stewarding shared context without outsourcing responsibility.

## Core distinctions to consider
- Transactional interasctions may look like: ask → receive → consume
- Context partnering may look like: build → test → reflect → revise (loop back)
