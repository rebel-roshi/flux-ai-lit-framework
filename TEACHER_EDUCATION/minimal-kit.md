# Minimum ingredients to teach this (teacher-ed ready)

1) North star + boundaries (what it is/isn’t)
2) Core moves in plain language (portable, teachable)
3) Failure modes + repair moves (“if you see X, try Y”)
4) Practice cycles (notice → try → reflect → repeat), not “levels”
5) Scenarios + exemplars (transfer engine)
6) Single-point rubric used as a mirror (evidence + next move)
7) Safety as practice (privacy/consent, attribution, verification)
8) Train-the-trainer facilitation kit (agendas, scripts, calibration)
