# Stewarding the Flux AI Literacy Framework

This repository is the canonical reference for the **Flux AI literacy framework** as I, Rebel Roshi, currently understand and steward it.

This repo is **downstream of Flux Protocol**. Flux Protocol is the upstream grounding; this repo operationalizes Flux-aligned ideas for AI literacy, teacher education, and auditable practice through concepts, core practices, cards, and artifacts.

## What is held stable here

The stable spine of this framework includes:

- the **working axioms**
- the **core practices**
- the category structure of the framework:
  - **Foundations → Concepts → Core practices → Cards → Artifacts**
- the commitment to making practice **auditable in artifacts**
- the Flux-aligned orientation toward non-coercive, responsibility-preserving interaction

Changes that substantially alter this spine may still be useful work, but they are no longer this framework as stewarded here.

## What is evolving here

The following are expected to evolve over time:

- concept files and explanatory framing
- facilitator-facing cards
- row packs
- scenarios
- examples
- alignment crosswalks
- teacher education materials
- routing and navigation aids

These materials are part of the living implementation of the framework and may expand, refine, or reorganize as the work matures.

## Relationship to Flux Protocol

Flux Protocol remains the upstream canonical reference for the protocol itself.

This repository does **not** replace the Flux Protocol repo. It translates selected Flux-aligned commitments into a framework for AI literacy and practice. Where this repo draws on or adapts Flux Protocol material, the upstream grounding remains in force and should be interpreted with that relationship in mind.

## Contribution posture

Contributions, adaptations, and extensions are welcome, especially in areas such as:

- examples
- row packs
- scenarios
- teacher education materials
- alignment/crosswalk work
- routing and legibility improvements

Changes to the **foundational layer** (working axioms, core practices, or major category boundaries) require higher care because they affect the identity of the framework itself.

When extending this repo, try to preserve the architectural distinction between:

- foundational claims
- concepts
- core practices
- facilitator-facing implementation cards
- artifact/evidence layers

## Canonical reference and local remix

This repo is the stewarded canonical reference for this framework as currently held here.

People are encouraged to remix, adapt, and apply the work in their own settings, but local adaptations should not automatically be assumed to redefine the canonical framework. In practice, this means:

- local use can be flexible
- canonical definitions should remain explicit
- major reinterpretations should be named as such

## License

Unless otherwise noted, this repository is shared under **CC BY-NC 4.0**.

Because this framework is downstream of Flux Protocol, that license choice also helps preserve coherence with the upstream repository.
