# Alignment Crosswalk

## Why alignment exists
- Make row packs portable across major AI literacy frameworks.
- Preserve our stable dimensions while translating to external terms.
- Support adoption without locking into a single vendor or policy stack.
- Enable mixed-domain use by tagging rows consistently.
- Make audit and reporting easier for leaders and reviewers.

## External frameworks referenced
- Digital Promise AI Literacy Framework (Understand / Evaluate / Use): [AI Literacy page](https://digitalpromise.org/initiative/artificial-intelligence-in-education/ai-literacy/), [Executive Summary PDF](https://digitalpromise.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/24cLSR0009-Exec-Summary-AI-Literacy-Framework-Paper_FINAL.pdf), [Infographic PDF](https://digitalpromise.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/24cLSR0009-Infographic-AI-Literacy-Framework-Paper_FINAL.pdf)
  - Note: Digital Promise also describes AI literacy core values and practices; row packs can optionally tag those at a finer grain (e.g., privacy/security, mis/disinformation, ethics/impact).
- AILit Framework (Engage / Create / Manage / Design): [Framework site](https://ailiteracyframework.org/), [Review Draft PDF](https://ailiteracyframework.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AILitFramework_ReviewDraft.pdf), [Official note on the four domains](https://school-education.ec.europa.eu/en/discover/news/give-your-feedback-new-ai-literacy-framework)

## Our stable dimensions
- Ownership
- Verification
- Context building
- UNKNWN handling
- Integrity & boundaries

## How to use this crosswalk
- Tag row packs or individual rows (not student evidence).
- Use 1–2 primary tags per row.
- Multi-tag only when a move truly spans frameworks.
- Tags are descriptive, not evaluative.
- When unsure, tag the move being practiced (ownership, verification, context building, UNKNWN handling, integrity & boundaries).

## Crosswalk table
| Our stable dimension | Digital Promise mode(s) | AILit domain(s) | Notes for row packs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ownership | Evaluate, Use, Understand | Engage, Manage | Rows that require learners to choose, justify, and steer the work rather than defer to AI. |
| Verification | Evaluate, Use, Understand | Manage, Engage | Rows that demand evidence checks, source scrutiny, or output testing. |
| Context building | Understand, Use | Engage, Create | Rows that build shared framing, constraints, and task clarity before or during use. |
| UNKNWN handling | Evaluate, Understand | Engage, Manage | Rows that name uncertainty, carry ambiguity, and take a bounded next step. |
| Integrity & boundaries | Understand, Evaluate, Use | Manage, Design | Rows that enforce disclosure, limits, academic integrity, and safe use decisions. |

## Row-pack tagging convention
- Digital Promise: `DP:UNDERSTAND`, `DP:EVALUATE`, `DP:USE`
- AILit: `AILIT:ENGAGE`, `AILIT:CREATE`, `AILIT:MANAGE`, `AILIT:DESIGN`
Rows may include multiple tags (e.g., `DP:EVALUATE` + `AILIT:MANAGE`) when a single move spans frameworks.

## One worked example
Assignment row set (grade 5 math, “Define a line”):
- Content rows:
  - `Define a line in your own words with a visual example.`
  - `Explain how a line differs from a line segment.`
- AI/context rows (tagged):
  - Tags: `DP:UNDERSTAND, AILIT:ENGAGE`
    Row: `State what you asked the AI and why it helped (or didn’t).`
  - Tags: `DP:EVALUATE, AILIT:MANAGE`
    Row: `Verify one AI claim using class notes/text and record any correction.`
