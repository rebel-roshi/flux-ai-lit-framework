# Working axioms

Working axioms are minimal commitments that keep the framework legible.

## Axiom 1 — Human attention sustains the loop
Any conversation continues because humans invest attention to keep it going. AI can participate by enriching the context, but it does not “want” the conversation to continue.

## Axiom 2 — Interaction frames are inferred and drift unless steered
Models infer an interaction frame (what we’re doing together). Without an explicit stance, that frame often collapses toward speed, compliance, and unearned certainty (help-me-fast vs help-me-learn).
