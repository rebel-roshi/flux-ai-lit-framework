# Core practices (canonical)

This is the canonical list of the five core practices. Each links to the facilitator-facing cards for operational detail.

## Ownership (agency / authorship)
Ownership keeps responsibility for meaning with the learner. Choices, reasoning, and revisions remain theirs even when tools contribute.
- Cards: [Core practice card](../LENSES/core-practice-cards.md#ownership-agency--authorship)

## Verification (validate with evidence)
Verification treats claims as candidates and checks them with domain evidence. Confidence is earned through testing, not assumed by plausibility.
- Cards: [Core practice card](../LENSES/core-practice-cards.md#verification-validate-with-evidence)

## Context building (make the frame workable)
Context building clarifies terms, assumptions, and constraints before trust or use. The frame becomes specific enough to verify and refine.
- Cards: [Core practice card](../LENSES/core-practice-cards.md#context-building-make-the-frame-workable)

## Staying with the unknown
Staying with the unknown names uncertainty without premature closure. It favors bounded next steps over guessing or avoidance.
- Cards: [Core practice card](../LENSES/core-practice-cards.md#staying-with-the-unknown)

## Integrity & boundaries (safe / honest / appropriate)
Integrity & boundaries keep the work honest, safe, and appropriate to policy and purpose. Disclosure and limits prevent hidden outsourcing.
