# Scenario: “Define a line” (Elementary) — Flux micro-moves while circulating

## Important note (explicit)
This is **one implementation** of Flux in an elementary context, under a frame we are **not fully exposing**
(groupwork norms, time, curriculum, assessment pressures, student readiness, etc.). It’s a projection, not a canon.

## Local frame (partial)
- Grade band: ~3–5
- Setting: students working in pairs/groups; teacher circulates and listens for formative cues
- Goal (today): students build shared meaning for “line” and distinguish it from “segment” and “ray”
- Constraint: keep it concrete (gesture, drawing, tools, examples); no formal coordinate definitions

## The moment the teacher walks up on
Student: “What’s a line?”  
AI (or student reading AI): “A line is a straight path that goes on forever in both directions.”

### Transactional risk
The group copies the sentence and stops thinking.

### Flux re-entry (without a speech)
The teacher doesn’t need to explain “starter ideas.” They just ask a question that re-opens the work.

# Path 1: [POKE] — Make one word unstable (micro-intervention)
**Teacher move (to students):**
- “What does **straight** mean?”

**Multi-modal prompts (only as needed):**
- “Show me straight with your hand. Now show me not-straight.”
- “Use a ruler—what changes?”
- “Can a straight line be slanted?”

**What the teacher is listening for (formative cues):**
- Do students confuse straight with horizontal?
- Can they generate non-examples (curves, bends)?

---

# Path 2: [UNKNWN] — Turn ‘forever’ into a representation problem (micro-intervention)
**Teacher move (to students):**
- “How would you **draw** ‘goes on forever’ on paper?”

**Multi-modal prompts (only as needed):**
- “If your pencil stops, did the line stop?”
- “How could a picture *suggest* it keeps going?”
- “What would be different if it *didn’t* go forever?”

**Formative cues:**
- Do students invent arrows or other conventions?
- Can they distinguish “keeps going” from “stops”?

---

# Path 3: [NOGUARD] — Restore ownership without shaming (micro-intervention)
This is the “AI authority drift” moment.

**Teacher move (to students):**
- “How can you **check** that this is true?”
or
- “Convince me without saying ‘because the computer said so.’”

**Follow-up prompts (only as needed):**
- “Draw an example that matches the sentence.”
- “Draw a non-example that *doesn’t* match.”
- “Now draw a segment. Now a ray. What’s different?”

**Formative cues:**
- Can students produce examples/non-examples?
- Can they name what changed (endpoints, arrows, straightness)?

---

## Collapse signals (what the teacher notices while circulating)
- Students copy the sentence and stop.
- Students defer to AI as authority (“it said so”).
- Students can’t produce examples/non-examples.

## Flux re-entry cheat-sheet (one-liners)
- [POKE] “What does **straight** mean?”
- [UNKNWN] “How do you draw **forever**?”
- [NOGUARD] “How can you **check** it’s true?”

---

## Note on AI as context partner during productive struggle
Students can return to AI **at any time** to ask for:
- alternative examples/non-examples,
- questions that help them test their idea,
- ways to show “forever” in a drawing,
as long as the group keeps ownership by **checking with drawings, tools, and shared reasoning**.
