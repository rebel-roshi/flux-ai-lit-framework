# Scenario: “Define a line” (Elementary projection)

## Important note
This is **one Flux projection** under a partially hidden frame (grade-level norms, time, curriculum goals, classroom culture). It is not “the way.”

## Local frame (partial)
- Grade band: ~3–5
- Aim: build a shared sense of “line” as a geometric idea students can draw, extend, and reason about.
- Constraint: keep language concrete; avoid formal coordinate equations.

## The moment (transactional start)
Student: “What’s a line?”  
AI (or a student reading AI): “A line is a straight path that goes on forever in both directions.”

## Flux re-entry (student-facing, light)
**[POKE]** Teacher: “What does *straight* mean? Show me with your hands / a ruler.”  
**[UNKNWN]** Teacher: “Does a line have endpoints? How can we tell?”  
**[NOGUARD]** Teacher: “Let’s treat that as a *candidate description* and test it with drawings.”

## Productive struggle moves (teacher holds back the map)
- Ask students to draw:
  - a line segment
  - a ray
  - “a line”
- Then ask: “What’s different? What stays the same?”

## Backstage AI support (teacher-only, confidence builder)
Teacher → AI:
“I’m teaching grade 4. Give me 5 student-friendly questions to distinguish line / segment / ray,
and 3 common misconceptions to watch for. Keep language simple.”

## Collapse signals
- Students treat the first sentence as the definition and stop exploring.
- “Line” becomes a memorized phrase rather than a tested idea.

## Optional extension
Have students invent their own definition and then refine it after testing:
- “Does your definition accidentally include segments?”
- “Does it exclude rays?”

# Scenario: “Define a line” (Middle school projection)

## Important note
This is **one Flux projection** under a partially hidden frame. Not canonical.

## Local frame (partial)
- Grade band: ~6–8 (pre-algebra / early algebra)
- Aim: connect “line” to patterns, graphs, and rate of change (without over-formalizing).
- Constraint: students may know `y = mx + b` but not its limitations.

## The moment (transactional start)
Student: “Define a line.”  
AI: “A line is a straight path extending infinitely in both directions.”

## Flux re-entry that preserves curiosity
**[POKE]** Teacher: “Okay—how would we *test* whether something is a line on a graph?”  
(Students suggest: “It looks straight,” “same slope,” “points line up.”)

**[UNKNWN]** Teacher: “Does ‘straight’ mean the same thing in a picture and in a table of values?”  
(Bring in tables / patterns.)

**[NOGUARD]** Teacher: “AI gave us a starting description. We’re going to build a version that works for today’s job: graphing and patterns.”

## The escape hatch *from inside the trap*
Teacher → AI (in front of students, but framed as inquiry):
“Help us poke holes in the phrase ‘straight path.’ Give 3 questions that would make this more precise for graphing and tables of values.”

Students pick one question and pursue it.

## Backstage AI support (teacher-only)
Teacher → AI:
“I’m teaching grade 7. I want students to discover why ‘line’ connects to constant rate of change.
Give me 6 Socratic questions and one simple counterexample that reveals a naive definition is incomplete,
without introducing formal geometry.”

## Collapse signals
- “Straight path forever” becomes a dead slogan.
- Students can’t connect line ↔ constant rate ↔ graph ↔ table.

## Optional extension (kept student-owned)
Have students propose a “working definition for this unit,” then test it against:
- a straight-looking but non-constant-rate graph (if appropriate)
- a constant-rate table that graphs as a line

# SCENARIOS/define-a-line-high.md
# Scenario: “Define a line” (High school projection)

## Important note
This is **one Flux projection** under a partially hidden frame. Not canonical.

## Local frame (partial)
- Grade band: ~9–11 (Algebra 1/2, coordinate geometry)
- Aim: make “line” precise enough to support equations, slope, and reasoning about all orientations.
- Constraint: don’t turn the lesson into a lecture on “many definitions.” Keep students doing the work.

## The moment (transactional start)
Student: “Define a line.”  
AI: “A line is a straight path extending infinitely in both directions.”

## Flux re-entry with minimal teacher giving
**[POKE]** Teacher: “Treat that as a candidate. What *breaks* if we use it as-is in coordinate geometry?”  
Students: “What about vertical lines?” “What does straight mean exactly?”

**[UNKNWN]** Teacher: “We need a definition that does a job: lets us decide if a point is on the line, graph it, and write equations.”  
(Students name the “job requirements.”)

**[NOGUARD]** Teacher: “We’re going to choose a working definition for *this frame* and verify it with examples.”

## In-room AI use that keeps agency with students
Teacher → AI:
“Give 3 candidate characterizations of a line in the coordinate plane suitable for Algebra 1 students.
For each, include one thing it handles well and one limitation (e.g., vertical lines).”

Teacher: “Which candidate best fits our job requirements? Defend your choice.”

Students choose; teacher then prompts verification:
- “Test with a vertical line.”
- “Test with two points and see if your definition predicts the same line.”

## Backstage AI support (teacher-only, optional)
Teacher → AI:
“I want to steer students to notice that `y = mx + b` doesn’t capture vertical lines,
and to arrive at a more general form without me telling them.
Give me a sequence of 5 questions and a quick example set.”

## Collapse signals
- Students treat `y = mx + b` as “the definition of a line.”
- AI output becomes authority rather than a candidate to test.

## Optional extension (frame-awareness without going ‘advanced’)
Teacher: “Notice: ‘definition’ depends on the job and the frame. We’re not saying anything goes.
We’re saying rigor lives in the assumptions we choose and the tests we run.”
