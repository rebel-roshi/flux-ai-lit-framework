# Scenario: “Define a line” (Middle school) — Flux micro-moves while circulating

## Important note (explicit)
This is **one implementation** of Flux in a middle school context, under a frame we are **not fully exposing**
(group norms, pacing, unit goals, assessment pressures, student readiness, etc.). It’s a projection, not a canon.

## Local frame (partial)
- Grade band: ~6–8
- Setting: students working in pairs/groups; teacher circulates for formative cues
- Goal (today): connect “line” to **consistent change** across representations (words ↔ table ↔ graph)
- Constraint: keep it concrete; avoid over-formal “many definitions” talk

---

## The moment the teacher walks up on
Student: “Define a line.”  
AI (or student reading AI): “A line is a straight path that goes on forever in both directions.”

### Transactional risk
Students copy the sentence and stop, without connecting to tables/graphs/patterns.

### Flux re-entry (without a speech)
A single question re-opens the meaning-making.

---

# Path 1: [POKE] — Make “straight” do work (micro-intervention)
**Teacher move (to students):**
- “What does **straight** mean on a graph? How can you tell?”

**Multi-modal prompts (only as needed):**
- “Show me with a sketch: straight vs not straight.”
- “Does ‘straight’ mean only horizontal?”
- “If I zoom in/out, does it still look straight?”

**Formative cues:**
- Do students confuse “straight” with “flat”?
- Can they describe straightness as “points line up” (not just vibes)?

---

# Path 2: [UNKNWN] — Bridge the representation gap (micro-intervention)
**Teacher move (to students):**
- “How would you recognize a line from a **table** without drawing it?”

**Multi-modal prompts (only as needed):**
- “What happens to y when x goes up by 1 each time?”
- “Is the change the same every step?”
- “Make a quick table that would graph as a line.”

**Formative cues:**
- Do students notice **constant difference / constant rate**?
- Can they generate a table and predict the graph shape?

---

# Path 3: [NOGUARD] — Restore ownership (micro-intervention)
**Teacher move (to students):**
- “How can you **check** that this definition fits what we’re doing today?”
or
- “Convince me without saying ‘because the AI said so.’”

**Follow-up prompts (only as needed):**
- “Give an example table + graph that matches your idea.”
- “Give a non-example: something that ‘looks kind of straight’ but doesn’t have consistent change.”
- “What evidence would you show a skeptical friend?”

**Formative cues:**
- Can students produce examples/non-examples across representations?
- Do they treat the definition as something to test, not memorize?

---

## Collapse signals (what the teacher notices while circulating)
- Students copy the sentence and can’t connect it to graphs/tables.
- “Straight” becomes a slogan; no evidence offered.
- Students defer to AI as authority.

## Flux re-entry cheat-sheet (one-liners)
- [POKE] “What does **straight** mean *on a graph*?”
- [UNKNWN] “How do you see a line in a **table**?”
- [NOGUARD] “How can you **check** it’s true?”

---

## Note on AI as context partner during productive struggle
Students can return to AI at any time for:
- example/non-example tables,
- questions that help them test straightness,
- ways to connect constant change ↔ straight graph,
as long as the group keeps ownership by **checking with tables/graphs and shared reasoning**.
